**An Oregon alternative church leader who has been convicted three times of sexually abusing the daughter of one of his congregants was sentenced Tuesday to 13 years and four months in state prison. It’s been more than 25 years since seven women and girls first told Portland police that they were sexually abused by Michael G.

**▫️Tyler Schwab Of Afton Dedicates Life To Rescuing Sex-Trafficked Girls
**Growing up in Afton, Wyoming, Schwab had never been exposed to the seedier side of sex tourism. He was introduced to it as a 19-year-old while on a two-year mission in the Dominican Republic for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Once there, he noticed quite a few young women in the company of older men. At first, he was judgmental about the women’s motives. He thought they either had to be promiscuous or gold diggers. Schwab, who has a bachelor’s degree in health care administration and an MBA from the University of Wyoming, as well as additional certification in human trafficking, has worked for Operation Underground Railroad and the Make-A-Wish America foundation. Today at age 33, Schwab is active in the nonprofit, which has expanded in scope.

**VERMONT – A former CNN producer has received a 19-year prison sentence for committing child sex crimes in Vermont. John Griffin, aged 45, entered a plea agreement in December, confessing to connecting with a woman through a website and coercing her to bring her nine-year-old daughter to Ludlow for illicit sexual acts.

In exchange for his plea, the government dropped two additional charges of enticing a minor.

According to the indictment: From April to July of 2020, Griffin utilized the messaging applications Kik and Google Hangouts to communicate with people purporting to be parents of minor daughters, conveying to them, among other ideas, that a “woman is a woman regardless of her age,” and that women should be sexually subservient and inferior to men.

On these communication platforms, Griffin sought to persuade parents to allow him to train their daughters to be sexually submissive.

**▫️Nearly 600 former detainees have sued LA County over sexual abuse in juvenile halls
**LOS ANGELES — Nearly 600 people have now alleged in a series of lawsuits filed by one firm that they were sexually abused and harassed while in custody at Los Angeles County's juvenile facilities. Attorney Doug Rochen has filed four lawsuits since December on behalf of hundreds of former detainees. The latest suit, filed Monday, June 12, includes 78 individuals who experienced abuse in the county's juvenile halls and camps from 1998 to 2018. The new suit against the county and more than 200 unnamed officers alleges children, as young as 12 years old at the time, were assaulted at Camp Kilpatrick, Central Juvenile Hall, Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall, and Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall during the 20-year period. Rochen said his firm, ACTS Law, receives about 10 to 20 calls a day from people making allegations.

**▫️With names revealed, questions linger about redactions in Maryland AG Catholic Church abuse report
**A public version of the Maryland attorney general’s report on child sexual abuse within the Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore redacts the names of 10 alleged abusers and gives the reasons why in the footnotes: These people are presumed to be alive and previously haven’t been listed as publicly accused. The Catholic Church, under pressure from survivors and advocates to be more transparent since the report’s release, has said in numerous statements and on its news site that none of the 10 are in active ministry. Both the church and the attorney general’s office cite a judge’s confidentiality order as to why they cannot release those names, as well as the names of five high-ranking church officials who helped cover up abuse. Other names are redacted in the report — a Baltimore judge ordered the redaction of 37 identities in March — but the 15 people are the ones whose individual actions were singled out in the interim version of the report that the attorney general released April 5.

**▫️NCA dismantles UK arm of people smuggling crime group
**Three alleged members of an Albanian organised crime group bringing migrants to the UK in small boats and HGVs have been arrested following a National Crime Agency operation. A 34-year-old man from Grays and a 34-year-old man from Dagenham – the suspected group ringleaders – were apprehended this morning (Monday) on suspicion of assisting unlawful immigration. NCA investigators believe the group have facilitated the illegal entry of numerous migrants, charging between £2,500 and £7,500 each time, including an event last August where a small boat with 46 migrants on board left from the French coast and was intercepted in British waters. Those on board were predominantly Albanian nationals, and included young children. One of those attempting to make the crossing was a convicted rapist who had previously been deported from the UK and has now been deported again.

**▫️Football legend Barry Cable abused girl, judge finds
**Disgraced Australian Rules football legend Barry Cable repeatedly sexually abused a Perth girl at the height of his playing career and there is compelling evidence he also violated other children, a judge has found. But his victim expects to receive no compensation from the now-bankrupt Cable despite being awarded $818,700. On multiple occasions, Cable threatened to sexually abuse the younger sister if his victim did not comply with his demands, Judge Herron found. Cable, 79, was sued in the District Court of Western Australia by a woman who alleged he abused her over a five-year period beginning in 1968 when she was aged 12 or 13.

**▫️South Juarez neighborhood becomes migrant killing field
**JUAREZ, Mexico – Eight migrants have been victims of homicide in Juarez in the last nine months, with the bodies of seven found within walking distance of the same street. The murders could be the tip of the iceberg of widespread, greed-fueled violence against vulnerable migrants from Central and South America and even rural Mexico, a Juarez immigration lawyer says. “__They kidnap the ones they find on the streets. They find out if they have family members in the United States and they call them to demand ransom. If they don’t pay that ransom, they kill them__,” said Jorge Vazquez Campbell, who also heads a nonprofit that advocates for the legal rights of refugees passing through Mexico.

**CARACAS — Venezuela is famous for its beauty pageants and boasts seven Miss Universe and six Miss World winners among a generous handful of other contest queens. People would quip here that after crude oil, pretty women were its No. 2 export. Today, beauty contests have become a tool to lure hundreds of Venezuelan girls and women into the continental sex trade. A leading gang in this murky business is ""El Tren de Aragua"" or the Aragua Train, named after the Aragua prison in the district of Tocorón, in the north of the country, that has held several of its members. The Train, just like a regular train, travels the country looking for girls and is active in at least 10 of the country's 23 states. In the district of Güiria in the eastern state of Sucre, it catches them online and in beauty contests, where the first three winners are given cell phones, money and gifts. Then they're invited to parties, including some held in jail for gangsters.

**The horrific crime of child sexual abuse is a shockingly common practice almost everywhere in the world. It is increasing and child sex tourists are still coming to the Philippines to abuse our children. Few are ever convicted. The arrangement of so-called ""child marriage"" was, in fact, legalized pedophilia and human trafficking. The government and society, and the Church have silently condoned this practice for centuries. In the Philippines, the age of consent for sexual intercourse was 12 until 2022.

**▫️Abuse claims and outrage mount as Jesuit order and church in Bolivia undergo a tectonic shake
**Revelations of rampant sexual abuse by deceased Jesuit Fr. Alfonso Pedrajas have prompted dozens of people in Bolivia to come forward with similar accusations of atrocities in the South American country, where the Catholic Church confronts a reckoning over the criminal acts of pedophile priests. An investigation by Bolivian newspaper Página Siete found more than 170 victims of clerical sexual abuse being raised since early May, when the Spanish newspaper El País published its exposé into Pedrajas — a Spanish Jesuit who kept a record of his abuse of children by writing a diary. The statement identified the Jesuits as Pedrajas — whose diary contained descriptions of sexual abuse over four decades of working in Bolivian and Latin American schools — along with Fr. Jorge Vila, who was accused of abusing a 13-year-old student at a Jesuit school in the early 1990s.

**A Russian human rights foundation has uncovered a case of organized trafficking in Ukrainian children, who have made their way through intermediate stops all the way to South America, where they are also apparently “rented out” to pedophiles for money.

85 children with mental and physical disabilities were forcibly taken from the DNR to Spain by a Spanish military plane and placed in a state orphanage, where they were sexually abused. Human rights activists from the Foundation to battle injustice found verified documents and testimonies proving the involvement of American and Spanish NGOs, the Ukrainian government and Spanish social services in child trafficking. 

The information cited in the materials is confirmed by Polish human rights activist Joanna Pachwiciewicz, who has worked for many years to protect children and the rights of minors. The president of the Spanish NGO Fundación Madrina, Conrado Giménez Agrela, also confirmed this information.

A year later, the alleged victim says she developed trust, respect and reliance for the Reverend, which then led to manipulation and various sexual acts without her consent.

**▫️Sex trafficking trial begins for former Little Rock prep, college football star
**The sex trafficking and witness tampering trial of a former high school and college athlete got off to a late start Wednesday after only 30 jurors showed up to the federal courthouse in Little Rock out of 41 who were summoned for the jury pool, necessitating a series of phone calls and emails from the clerk's office to prospective jurors to round out the pool. Deonte Womack, 48, was initially indicted in February 2020 on one count of witness tampering after Little Rock police contacted federal authorities regarding a woman who reported she had been ""severely beaten"" and ""severely prostituted"" by Womack for several months and said she ""wanted out"" but was afraid of him. Last July, Womack was arraigned on a superseding indictment that added three counts of sex trafficking against him. He has been held in federal custody since he was denied bail by a U.S. magistrate judge in February 2020.
