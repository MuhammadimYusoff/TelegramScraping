**Growing up in Afton, Wyoming, Schwab had never been exposed to the seedier side of sex tourism. He was introduced to it as a 19-year-old while on a two-year mission in the Dominican Republic for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Once there, he noticed quite a few young women in the company of older men. At first, he was judgmental about the women‚Äôs motives. He thought they either had to be promiscuous or gold diggers. Schwab, who has a bachelor‚Äôs degree in health care administration and an MBA from the University of Wyoming, as well as additional certification in human trafficking, has worked for Operation Underground Railroad and the Make-A-Wish America foundation. Today at age 33, Schwab is active in the nonprofit, which has expanded in scope.

**VERMONT ‚Äì A former CNN producer has received a 19-year prison sentence for committing child sex crimes in Vermont. John Griffin, aged 45, entered a plea agreement in December, confessing to connecting with a woman through a website and coercing her to bring her nine-year-old daughter to Ludlow for illicit sexual acts.

In exchange for his plea, the government dropped two additional charges of enticing a minor.

According to the indictment: From April to July of 2020, Griffin utilized the messaging applications Kik and Google Hangouts to communicate with people purporting to be parents of minor daughters, conveying to them, among other ideas, that a ‚Äúwoman is a woman regardless of her age,‚Äù and that women should be sexually subservient and inferior to men.

On these communication platforms, Griffin sought to persuade parents to allow him to train their daughters to be sexually submissive.

**‚ñ´Ô∏èFootball legend Barry Cable abused girl, judge finds
**Disgraced Australian Rules football legend Barry Cable repeatedly sexually abused a Perth girl at the height of his playing career and there is compelling evidence he also violated other children, a judge has found. But his victim expects to receive no compensation from the now-bankrupt Cable despite being awarded $818,700. On multiple occasions, Cable threatened to sexually abuse the younger sister if his victim did not comply with his demands, Judge Herron found. Cable, 79, was sued in the District Court of Western Australia by a woman who alleged he abused her over a five-year period beginning in 1968 when she was aged 12 or 13.

**‚ñ´Ô∏è""The Aragua Train"" ‚Äî How Venezuelan Beauty Pageants Feed A Global Sex Trafficking Ring
**CARACAS ‚Äî Venezuela is famous for its beauty pageants and boasts seven Miss Universe and six Miss World winners among a generous handful of other contest queens. People would quip here that after crude oil, pretty women were its No. 2 export. Today, beauty contests have become a tool to lure hundreds of Venezuelan girls and women into the continental sex trade. A leading gang in this murky business is ""El Tren de Aragua"" or the Aragua Train, named after the Aragua prison in the district of Tocor√≥n, in the north of the country, that has held several of its members. The Train, just like a regular train, travels the country looking for girls and is active in at least 10 of the country's 23 states. In the district of G√ºiria in the eastern state of Sucre, it catches them online and in beauty contests, where the first three winners are given cell phones, money and gifts. Then they're invited to parties, including some held in jail for gangsters.

**TOKYO - An investigation by a major Japanese talent agency into sexual abuse allegations against its founder won‚Äôt address monetary or criminality questions but rather aims to prevent such cases in the future, the lead investigator said Monday. Allegations against Johnny Kitagawa, a powerful figure in Japanese entertainment, have been tossed around for decades but he was never charged with any crime. He died in 2019. The allegations resurfaced as a topic for scrutiny after BBC News produced a special segment earlier this year focused on several people who said they were sexually abused as youngsters while working at the company.

Alfonso Pedrajas have prompted dozens of people in Bolivia to come forward with similar accusations of atrocities in the South American country, where the Catholic Church confronts a reckoning over the criminal acts of pedophile priests. An investigation by Bolivian newspaper P√°gina Siete found more than 170 victims of clerical sexual abuse being raised since early May, when the Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s published its expos√© into Pedrajas ‚Äî a Spanish Jesuit who kept a record of his abuse of children by writing a diary. The statement identified the Jesuits as Pedrajas ‚Äî whose diary contained descriptions of sexual abuse over four decades of working in Bolivian and Latin American schools ‚Äî along with Fr. Jorge Vila, who was accused of abusing a 13-year-old student at a Jesuit school in the early 1990s.

**A Russian human rights foundation has uncovered a case of organized trafficking in Ukrainian children, who have made their way through intermediate stops all the way to South America, where they are also apparently ‚Äúrented out‚Äù to pedophiles for money.

85 children with mental and physical disabilities were forcibly taken from the DNR to Spain by a Spanish military plane and placed in a state orphanage, where they were sexually abused. Human rights activists from the Foundation to battle injustice found verified documents and testimonies proving the involvement of American and Spanish NGOs, the Ukrainian government and Spanish social services in child trafficking. 

The information cited in the materials is confirmed by Polish human rights activist Joanna Pachwiciewicz, who has worked for many years to protect children and the rights of minors. The president of the Spanish NGO Fundaci√≥n Madrina, Conrado Gim√©nez Agrela, also confirmed this information.

Deonte Womack, 48, was initially indicted in February 2020 on one count of witness tampering after Little Rock police contacted federal authorities regarding a woman who reported she had been ""severely beaten"" and ""severely prostituted"" by Womack for several months and said she ""wanted out"" but was afraid of him. Last July, Womack was arraigned on a superseding indictment that added three counts of sex trafficking against him. He has been held in federal custody since he was denied bail by a U.S. magistrate judge in February 2020.
